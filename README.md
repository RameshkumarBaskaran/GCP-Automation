The Centrify Privileged Identity Management solution provides a set of controls for Google Compute Engine Linux VM Instances to support Enterprise integrated identity and access management functions. This solution enables organizations to consolidate identities, enforce cross-platform least privilege access and control shared accounts, while securing remote access and auditing all privileged sessions.

This guide will show how to setup and configure Active Directory based identity and access controls as well as privilege management for Linux VM Instances running on Google Cloud Platform. It will also show how to take over password management for local root accounts as well as to provide secure remote access to these Linux VM Instances.
